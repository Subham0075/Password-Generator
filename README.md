# Password-Generator
This program generates random password of your spefications.
For this project I imported "random" , created lists for letters, numbers & symbols.
"for" loop is used with "range" to iterate through the lists and randomly select the letters, numbers & symbols
the number of times I specified.
After that "append" is used to add it to a new list to generate the password.
This is the overall functionality of this code.
